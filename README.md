# File encryption program using Python 
FileCrypt is a program that encrypts the selected file with AES 256 bit encryption using a 32 byte password that the user inputs, the password is then passed into a password based key derivative function (PBKDF2) which allows a user to enter a password which will be converted into the key for encryption.
